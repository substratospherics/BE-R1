      <h4>REASON 1</h4>

        <h3>
          Due to their difficulty in synthesis and lower importance for survival
          and reproduction than other colors, blue pigments like anthocyanins
          and delphinidins are less common in plants and animals than other
          hues.
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            These blue pigments are frequently generated as secondary
            metabolites, which means they are not required for fundamental
            metabolic functions and may have evolved for particular goals like
            luring pollinators or discouraging herbivores. Blue pigments are
            also regularly produced in response to environmental pressures like
            UV radiation, rather than being a persistent characteristic.
          </li>
          <li>
            Contrarily, pigments like chlorophyll in plants and carotenoids in
            animals are more often found since they are required for
            photosynthesis and visual communication, respectively.
          </li>
          <li>
            To explain, photosynthesis—the process by which plants turn light
            energy into chemical energy in the form of glucose—requires
            chlorophyll, the green pigment found in plants. Chlorophyll reflects
            green light and gives plants their characteristic color by absorbing
            light mostly in the blue and red spectrums. Chlorophyll pigments are
            located in chloroplasts, which are organelles unique to plant cells
            that are used for photosynthesis. Chlorophyll is present in nearly
            all plants since photosynthesis is essential for their life and
            development.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the other hand, there exist pigments known as carotenoids that
            are found in the skin, feathers, and scales of animals and are
            responsible for their yellow, orange, and red hues. These pigments
            do not contribute to photosynthesis, but they do help animals
            communicate visually by attracting potential partners, protecting
            territory, and blending in with their surroundings. Carotenoids also
            have added benefits for animals, as they act as protectors of cells
            by neutralizing harmful molecules referred to as free radicals.
          </li>
          <li>
            As a result, chlorophyll and carotenoids are each crucial pigments
            for their respective organisms. Chlorophyll is required for
            photosynthesis, which is vital for plant survival and growth,
            whereas carotenoids are required for visible communication and have
            antioxidant houses. As a result, they are more prominent but not
            uncommon than blue pigments.
